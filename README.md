## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Getting Started

To get the full Personal Finance Dashboard application up and running on your local machine, or to understand the deployment process, please refer to the specific component READMEs for comprehensive instructions.

### Quick Local Setup with Docker Compose (Recommended)

For the quickest way to get all services (frontend, backend, MongoDB, NGINX) running locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GarvBakliwal/fintechhub.git
    cd fintechhub
    ```
2.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    * Create a `.env.frontend` file in the root directory (or `frontend/.env.local` if Next.js specific). Refer to [`README-Frontend.md`](./README-Frontend.md) for required variables.
    * Create a `.env.backend` file in the root directory (or `backend/.env` if Node.js specific). Refer to [`README-Backend.md`](./README-Backend.md) for required variables.
    * Crucially, ensure your Plaid, Google OAuth, and JWT secrets are correctly configured.
3.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose**:
    ```bash
    # Ensure Docker Desktop is running
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
    This command will build the Docker images for your frontend and backend, set up a MongoDB container, configure NGINX as a reverse proxy, and start all services in detached mode.

Once all services are up, you can typically access the frontend application through your browser at `http://localhost`.

## üì¶ Installation

To set up the frontend application on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GarvBakliwal/fintechhub.git
    cd fintechhub
    ```
    * **Note**: If you cloned the monorepo, navigate into the `frontend` directory first.
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    # or pnpm install
    ```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables (`.env.local`)

Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend/` directory based on the `.env.local.example` provided. These variables are crucial for the application to function correctly.

* REQUIRED
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080  # Or your deployed backend URL (e.g., https://api.your-domain.com)
```
* PLAID INTEGRATION (Consult Plaid documentation for values)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAID_CLIENT_ID=your_plaid_client_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAID_ENV=sandbox # Options: sandbox, development, production
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAID_PRODUCTS=transactions,auth # Comma-separated list of Plaid products (e.g., transactions,auth,identity)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAID_COUNTRY_CODES=US # Comma-separated list of country codes (e.g., US,CA)
```
> ‚úÖ **Security Note**: Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. It contains sensitive keys and configurations specific to your environment. `.gitignore` should already be configured to exclude it.

---

## üß™ Development

To run the frontend application in development mode with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
# or yarn dev
# or pnpm dev
```
The application will typically be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Production Build
To build the application for production and serve it:

Build the project:
```Bash
npm run build
# or yarn build
# or pnpm build
```
This command compiles the Next.js application into optimized static assets and server-side code.
Start the production server:
```Bash
npm start
# or yarn start
# or pnpm start
```
This will serve the production build. Ensure your `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` is set to your deployed backend URL.

---

* **Register/Login:** Use the built-in forms.
* **Connect Bank Accounts:** After logging in, you'll be prompted to connect your financial institutions via Plaid Link. Follow the on-screen instructions.
* **View Dashboard:** Once accounts are linked, navigate to the dashboard to see an overview of your accounts and transactions.
* **Explore Transactions:** Dive into detailed transaction lists, often with filtering or sorting options.

---

## ü§ù Contributing
We welcome contributions to the Personal Finance Dashboard Frontend!

* **Setup:** Follow the Installation and Development steps.
* **Branching:** Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

  ```Bash
