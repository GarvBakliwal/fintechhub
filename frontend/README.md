## üì¶ Installation

To set up the frontend application on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GarvBakliwal/fintechhub.git
    cd fintechhub
    ```
    * **Note**: If you cloned the monorepo, navigate into the `frontend` directory first.
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    # or pnpm install
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables (`.env.local`)

Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend/` directory based on the `.env.local.example` provided. These variables are crucial for the application to function correctly.

* REQUIRED
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080  # Or your deployed backend URL (e.g., https://api.your-domain.com)
```
* PLAID INTEGRATION (Consult Plaid documentation for values)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAID_CLIENT_ID=your_plaid_client_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAID_ENV=sandbox # Options: sandbox, development, production
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAID_PRODUCTS=transactions,auth # Comma-separated list of Plaid products (e.g., transactions,auth,identity)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAID_COUNTRY_CODES=US # Comma-separated list of country codes (e.g., US,CA)
```
> ‚úÖ **Security Note**: Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. It contains sensitive keys and configurations specific to your environment. `.gitignore` should already be configured to exclude it.

---

## üß™ Development

To run the frontend application in development mode with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
# or yarn dev
# or pnpm dev
```
The application will typically be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Production Build
To build the application for production and serve it:

Build the project:
```Bash
npm run build
# or yarn build
# or pnpm build
```
This command compiles the Next.js application into optimized static assets and server-side code.
Start the production server:
```Bash
npm start
# or yarn start
# or pnpm start
```
This will serve the production build. Ensure your `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` is set to your deployed backend URL.
